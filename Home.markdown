#Getting the Device Running#

There are two ways to get the shared memory device running.   The first is with _only_ shared memory; the second is with shared memory and interrupts.  The second method requires an external shared memory server.

Example programs for both approaches are in the guest-code.git repository.

The Shared Memory Server is in shmem-server.git repository
